## Description
 This a command-line application that uses the inquirer npm to prompt the user with a series of questions and takes their input responses to generate a ReadMe markdown file. This application looks to save the user time by eliminating the need to create ReadMe.Md files for every project they create and post to Github. Creating this application helped me learn and practice using node, npm packages, and creating content dynamically with Javascript.
